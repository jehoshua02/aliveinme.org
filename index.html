        <p>Alive In Me AIMs to shine a light in the dark places created by the
        sudden death of a child through outreach and support of the family.</p>
        <p>In life's darkest time, families need something positive to look
        forward to, a light in the dark.</p>
        <p>We also AIM to honor those children gone too soon by providing support
        for children's arts, academics, and athletics.</p>

      <div class="section__content">
        <p>To honor Caleb, as the inspiration for this work, we AIM to educate
        and raise awareness for organ, eye, and tissue donation.</p>
        <p>While Caleb's time on earth was just shy of three years, his good
        works and love continue to live on because of organ donation.  His gifts
        saved lives and provided new hope to many.</p>
        <p>The peace, comfort, and hope found through donation comes to both
        recipient and donor families.</p>
        <p>Alive In Me strives to share this message.</p>
