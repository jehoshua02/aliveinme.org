> Our Mission:  Alive In Me AIMs to shine a light in the dark places created by
the sudden death of a child through outreach and support of the family.  In
life's darkest time, families need something positive to look forward to, a
light in the dark.  We also AIM to honor those children gone too soon by
providing support for children's arts, academics, and athletics.

> Why organ donation?   To honor Caleb, as the inspiration for this work, we AIM
to educate and raise awareness for organ, eye, and tissue donation.  While
Caleb's time on earth was just shy of three years, his good works and love
continue to live on because of organ donation.  His gifts saved lives and
provided new hope to many.  The peace, comfort, and hope found through donation
comes to both recipient and donor families.  Alive In Me strives to share this
message.
